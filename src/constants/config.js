Most are miserable (2 fellas in kitchen smile, as do bellboys) Standard room tiny, you can only get out of 1 side of the bed, no where for cases except on dressing table. We got used to it but wouldn't go back. Unfortunately we had 12 nights here.",

            "We enjoyed our stay at this new property but unfortunately there aren't any rooms with a view, even though it says there is. There is construction in the front as well as on the side of the property, which can be noisy and doesn't alow for naps in the afternoon. We booked a room with a balcony and mountain view but apparently if you have a balony then you can't have a mountain view, so be careful when booking. Our balcony room was next to the contruction sight and we couldn't opent he door because of all the dust and noise. We requested to move rooms and only after insisting did they change us. The front desk were nice and helpful. overall it's a good place for price and location. Id come back but only after the construction is over with",
